# Automated Machine Learning Web Application

This project presents an **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Web Application**, developed using Python, YData-Profiling, PyCaret, and Streamlit. The app is designed to democratise access to machine learning by automating essential processes such as data profiling, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and export.

## üîß Technologies Used

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)
The application is built using Python‚Äîa powerful, flexible programming language widely adopted in data science and machine learning. Its extensive ecosystem supports rapid development and robust machine learning workflows.

### [YData-Profiling (formerly Pandas-Profiling)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/)
This library facilitates **automated exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, allowing users to instantly generate comprehensive data profiles. These include overviews of data types, missing values, distributions, and correlations‚Äîempowering users to understand their datasets before modelling.

### [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)
PyCaret offers a **low-code environment** for training and deploying machine learning models. It simplifies tasks like feature selection, model comparison, and hyperparameter tuning. With its support for a wide range of algorithms, PyCaret enables users to build and benchmark models efficiently.

### [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
Streamlit enables the creation of intuitive, interactive user interfaces for machine learning applications. Users can upload datasets, inspect data profiles, select modelling targets, configure model parameters, and train models‚Äîall within a sleek and minimalistic interface.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Drag-and-drop dataset upload
- Instant data profiling via YData-Profiling
- Automated model comparison and selection using PyCaret
- Easy export of trained models
- Intuitive, no-code interface via Streamlit

This application is ideal for both beginners and professionals who want to streamline the machine learning pipeline without writing extensive code. It provides a foundation for understanding model behaviour while speeding up the experimentation process.
